# Self-hosted CI runner — the Actions-minutes escape hatch (PI-666)

When a **private** repo exhausts its GitHub Actions minutes (or hits a
spending-limit/payment problem), every workflow job fails at start:
*"The job was not started because recent account payments have failed or your
spending limit needs to be increased."* Self-hosted runners bill **zero**
minutes on private repos, and checks keep reporting to GitHub — branch
protection and the merge gate stay intact.

The scaffolded `ci.yml` reads `vars.CI_RUNS_ON` on its compute jobs; one repo
variable routes them to your machine. Nothing else changes.

## Diagnose first

```bash
gh run list --limit 5 --json conclusion,displayTitle   # billing lockout shows startup_failure
gh api /users/{username}/settings/billing/actions      # included vs used minutes (org repos: /orgs/{org}/...)
```

Meanwhile, verification never stops: `just ci` runs the exact same gate
locally (the recipes are what CI runs), and the pre-push git hook already
enforces it.

## Set up the runner (once)

1. Repo → **Settings → Actions → Runners → New self-hosted runner**, or:

   ```bash
   gh api -X POST repos/{owner}/{repo}/actions/runners/registration-token --jq .token
   ```

2. On the machine that will run CI (Linux x64 shown):

   ```bash
   mkdir -p ~/actions-runner && cd ~/actions-runner
   # download + extract the runner package per the Settings page instructions
   ./config.sh --url https://github.com/{owner}/{repo} --token <TOKEN> --ephemeral
   ./run.sh   # or install as a service: sudo ./svc.sh install && sudo ./svc.sh start
   ```

   **Prefer `--ephemeral`** — the runner takes one job and unregisters, so a
   compromised job can't persist on the machine. Re-register per job via a
   small loop or the service.

3. Install the host prerequisites below. The workflows install most of their
   own toolchain via pinned actions, so "the first run tells you what's
   missing" is only half-true — see the next section for the half it doesn't.

## Host prerequisites (PI-840)

The scaffolded workflows provision their own tools where they can (pinned
actions install `just`, `shfmt`, the language toolchain, gitleaks, semgrep) —
but they **assume** a few binaries are already on the host, because GitHub's
`ubuntu-24.04` images preinstall them. A bare box (fresh WSL distro, minimal
container) does not. The failure mode is nasty: a missing binary kills the
step with **exit 127** mid-job — `command not found` deep inside a workflow
step reads as a failure of whatever that step checks, not an environment
problem (observed live: a missing `jq` on a fresh WSL box masqueraded as a
PR-metadata failure and cost a debugging detour).

Assumed-present binaries:

| Binary | Used by | Debian/Ubuntu install |
|---|---|---|
| `git` | checkout, every workflow step that touches the repo | `sudo apt install git` |
| `curl` | download/API steps | `sudo apt install curl` |
| `tar`, `gzip` | action tool downloads | usually present |
| `gh` | `ci.yml`'s post-failure PR comment step runs `gh pr comment` on this runner whenever a PR job fails; `validate-pr` (a required check) runs `gh issue view` here on every PR | [cli.github.com](https://cli.github.com) |
| `jq` | JSON parsing in `validate-pr`, which runs here on every PR, and in the pinned lifecycle workflows if you ever route those here | `sudo apt install jq` |
| `shellcheck` | the shell-lint step (preinstalled on GitHub images — **absent on bare hosts**) | `sudo apt install shellcheck` |
| `docker` | container image jobs, if enabled | [docs.docker.com/engine/install](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) |

Preflight a new runner host with:

```bash
for b in git curl tar gzip gh jq shellcheck; do
  command -v "$b" >/dev/null || echo "MISSING: $b"
done
```

## Switch CI over

```bash
just ci-local-on     # gh variable set CI_RUNS_ON --body self-hosted
just ci-local-off    # back to GitHub-hosted
```

**Only set the variable when a runner is actually registered and online** —
otherwise jobs queue forever, which is harder to notice than the billing
error.

**Single runner = sequential CI.** One runner executes jobs one at a time
(~15–20 min for a full pipeline). Register a second runner to restore
parallelism.
The lifecycle scripts' CI wait defaults to 900s — set `PI_CI_TIMEOUT`
(seconds) in the environment where you run `finish_pr.sh` / `monitor_pr.sh`
(e.g. `PI_CI_TIMEOUT=1800`) so the merge flow survives sequential runs.


**A hung job holds that runner.** Every `ci.yml` job carries a `timeout-minutes`
(GitHub's default is 360). Container CPU limits do not change the CPU count tools
see, so anything sized by it oversubscribes a small runner.
`just test-mutation` runs one mutmut worker unless `MUTMUT_MAX_CHILDREN` is
set for that run. `pytest -n auto` starts no more workers than the runner's cgroup
has CPUs and memory for (512 MiB each; the root `conftest.py`); a heavier suite
sets `PYTEST_XDIST_AUTO_NUM_WORKERS` or passes `-n N`.

## Trust model — read before enabling

- Use this only on **private repos with trusted collaborators**. A
  self-hosted runner executes whatever the workflow (and the PR) tells it to,
  on your machine.
- Never process public-fork PRs on a self-hosted runner.
- Secret/PAT-bearing workflows (`board-automation`,
  `issue-validation`, `project-init-upgrade`) — including any
  release/deploy/registry-publish workflows you enable — are **deliberately
  pinned** to GitHub-hosted ephemeral runners so tokens never materialize on
  your machine. They cost seconds and fit the free tier once `ci.yml` moves
  off. Do not point them at `CI_RUNS_ON`.
- Every job that stays GitHub-hosted — `scorecard` (an OSSF requirement) and
  the pinned workflows above — carries `vars.CI_RUNS_ON == ''` in its `if:`,
  so while `CI_RUNS_ON` is set it concludes **skipped**, not a failed run that
  could never start. Unset the variable and they run again.
- `validate-pr` follows `CI_RUNS_ON`: it is a required check, so pinned it
  would block every merge during a lockout. It carries only the job's
  read-only `github.token` (issues + pull-requests read), no PAT.

## Known-dead checks during the lockout (PI-837)

The GitHub-hosted workflows above keep **failing permanently** while the
billing lockout lasts — each run dies as a zero-step `startup_failure`.
Those failures register as checks on your PRs, and `monitor_pr.sh --merge`
blocks on any failing check, so one dead check would deadlock every PR even
though real CI is green on your runner. Name such checks in
`.agents/config.yaml`:

```yaml
  monitor_ignore_checks: ["board-sync"]   # reported, never blocking
```

(or per-run: `PI_MONITOR_IGNORE_CHECKS=board-sync monitor_pr.sh …`). The
check is still printed — marked informational — and the merge proceeds.
Remove the entry once billing recovers; the gate reverts to blocking.

**Gotcha — check runs attach to commits, not PRs.** A branch created while
pointing at the same commit as another PR's head shares that commit's check
rollup: a failure produced by the sibling's PR events appears on *your* PR
too, and can re-block it after you already worked around the failure. Remedy:
give the PR a unique head commit —

```bash
git commit --allow-empty -m "chore: refresh PR head" && .agents/scripts/push_branch.sh
```

which clears the stale failure from this PR's rollup.

## Alternatives

Make the repo public (Actions is free), raise the spending limit, or wait for
the monthly reset. `act` (nektos/act, needs Docker) can run workflows ad hoc,
but image drift from real runners makes it a debugging project of its own —
prefer the runner.
