# Diagnose the silent forever-block (PI-819): a REQUIRED status check that no
# workflow job ever reports.
#
# Branch protection is written once, at scaffold time, by setup_github.sh. The
# workflows keep evolving — jobs get renamed, a matrix stops fanning out per-PR
# (PI-761). A required context that no job produces is never reported, so it stays
# pending forever: `mergeStateStatus` is BLOCKED, every check is green, no error is
# printed anywhere, and EVERY pull request in the repo becomes unmergeable.
#
# There is nothing to see in the CI logs, because CI passed. This script names the
# phantom contexts and the fix.
#
# Usage: check_branch_protection.sh [PR_NUMBER]
#   Defaults to the PR for the current branch. A PR is required: see below.
# Exit 0 = protection is satisfiable; 1 = phantom contexts found; 0 also when the
# state cannot be determined (no gh, not authed, no protection) — a diagnostic must
# never itself block a workflow.
