# Wait for all CI checks on a PR, then optionally merge.
# Only prints failures or the final pass line — no per-refresh noise.
# Requires: gh, a Python 3 (resolved via ../hooks/_py.sh; stdlib only — no jq).
#
# Usage:
#   .agents/scripts/monitor_pr.sh <pr-number> [--merge] [--review-cycle N] [--no-review] [--admin]
#
# --merge: squash-merge and delete branch automatically when all checks pass.
# --review-cycle N: current review fix cycle count (0-based, default 0).
#   When N >= MAX_REVIEW_CYCLES and review/decision is still failing or pending,
#   force-merges with --admin.
# --no-review: skip all review waiting and admin-merge after CI passes.
#   Use ONLY for solo-dev PRs where no human reviewer will ever respond.
#   Do NOT use to avoid addressing legitimate review feedback.
# --admin: allow an admin override when the PR is BLOCKED by branch protection
#   AFTER the review gate passed (e.g. an unresolved conversation). Without it,
#   a post-review BLOCKED state fails with guidance instead of silently
#   overriding the protection setup_github.sh provisioned (2026-07 review).
#
# Full lifecycle for agents:
#   1. .agents/scripts/monitor_pr.sh <n> --merge
#   2. Exit 2 -> review comments printed -> read and address them, push
#   3. Re-run with --review-cycle 1
#   4. Exit 2 again -> address remaining comments, push
#   5. Re-run with --review-cycle 2 -> admin-merge fires if still blocked
#
# Review cycle policy:
#   Two fix cycles are required before admin-merge is allowed. This ensures
#   review feedback (including Copilot comments) is read and addressed at
#   least once before force-merging.
#
# Ignored (informational) checks — PI-837:
#   `monitor_ignore_checks` in .agents/config.yaml (single-line JSON array of
#   check names; per-run override: PI_MONITOR_IGNORE_CHECKS, comma-separated)
#   names checks that are reported but never block the merge. Use it for a
#   known-dead check: during a GitHub Actions billing lockout, GitHub-hosted
#   jobs die permanently as zero-step startup failures while self-hosted CI
#   stays green — without this list one dead check deadlocks every PR.
#
#   Gotcha: check runs attach to COMMITS, not PRs. A sibling branch created at
#   the same head commit shares its check rollup — a failure produced by the
#   other branch's PR events shows up here too (observed: zarija #130/#131).
#   Remedy when it happens: give the PR a unique head, e.g.
#     git commit --allow-empty -m "chore: refresh PR head" && push
#   which clears the stale failure from this PR's rollup.
