# Local CI — when GitHub Actions minutes run out

On a **private** repo that exhausts its Actions minutes (or hits a
spending-limit/payment problem), every job fails at start and the required
checks never report — the merge gate stalls. Verification itself never
stops (see step 2); only the remote checks do.

## 1. Diagnose — confirm it's the billing lockout

```bash
gh run list --limit 5 --json conclusion,displayTitle
```

The lockout signature is `startup_failure` with the annotation *"The job was
not started because recent account payments have failed or your spending
limit needs to be increased."* Check remaining minutes:

```bash
# Enhanced billing platform (current; filter for Actions usage):
gh api "/users/{username}/settings/billing/usage" --jq '[.usageItems[] | select(.product == "actions")]'
gh api "/organizations/{org}/settings/billing/usage" --jq '[.usageItems[] | select(.product == "actions")]'
# Accounts not yet on the enhanced platform: the legacy endpoint still answers:
gh api /users/{username}/settings/billing/actions
```

If runs are failing for any *other* reason, this skill does not apply — fix
the actual failure.

## 2. Immediate unblock — the gate already runs locally

`just ci` runs the **same recipes CI runs** (the justfile is the single
command surface), and the pre-push git hook already enforces it on every
push. Nothing about correctness is blocked — keep working; only the merge
gate needs the fix below.

## 3. Durable fix — self-hosted runner (zero billed minutes)

Follow `.agents/docs/guides/self-hosted-ci-runner.md`: register a runner
(**`--ephemeral` recommended**), verify it shows online under Settings →
Actions → Runners, then:

```bash
just ci-local-on    # sets the CI_RUNS_ON repo variable → compute jobs run on your runner
```

Checks keep reporting to GitHub; branch protection and the merge gate stay
intact. Revert any time with `just ci-local-off`.

**Do not set the variable before the runner is online** — jobs queue forever,
which is quieter and worse than the billing error.

## 4. Honest alternatives

- Make the repo **public** — Actions becomes free.
- Raise the spending limit (Settings → Billing).
- Wait for the monthly reset (usage resets on your billing date).

## Safety rails (non-negotiable)

- The secret/PAT-bearing workflows are deliberately pinned to GitHub-hosted
  runners — never point them at `CI_RUNS_ON`.
- Never bypass required checks by posting statuses from local runs —
  self-attestation defeats the gate; the runner path keeps real checks.
- Self-hosted runners are for private repos with trusted collaborators only;
  never for public-fork PRs.
