Mark PR $ARGUMENTS (or current branch's PR if omitted) ready for review.

## Steps

1. **Promote to ready**:
   ```bash
   .claude/scripts/promote_review.sh $ARGUMENTS
   ```
   `board-automation.yml` moves the board card to **In Review** automatically.

2. **Next steps**: Reviewers will be pinged. When they request changes, they'll post comments on the PR.
