Save this to project memory: $ARGUMENTS

**First check the memory tier is enabled.** If `.claude/memory/` does not exist, this project declined the memory tier (`--memory none`) — do **not** create it. Tell the user memory is not enabled here and stop.

Otherwise, follow the memory convention in `.claude/memory/README.md`:

1. Decide the memory type (user / feedback / project / reference)
2. Choose a descriptive filename (e.g., `feedback_testing.md`, `project_deadline.md`)
3. Check if an existing memory file already covers this — update it instead of duplicating
4. Write the file with proper frontmatter (name, description, type)
5. Add a one-line entry to `.claude/memory/MEMORY.md`
