Summarize this session and save it:

**First check where to save.** This skill targets the Obsidian vault. If `.claude/vault/` does not exist, this project has no vault (memory tier is `none` or `auto`) — do **not** create it; instead save to `.claude/memory/` if that exists, or otherwise just print the summary to the user without writing a file.

1. **Gather context**:
   - Run `git log --since='2 hours ago' --oneline` for recent commits
   - Run `git diff --stat` for uncommitted changes
   - Review the conversation for key decisions and discoveries

2. **Write the summary** to `.claude/vault/sessions/` with today's date (or the fallback location above):
   ```
   # Session YYYY-MM-DD (manual)

   ## What was done
   - (bullet list of completed work)

   ## Decisions made
   - (any architectural or approach decisions, with reasoning)

   ## Open items
   - (anything left unfinished or discovered but not addressed)

   ## Notes
   - (anything else worth remembering)
   ```

3. **Update memory** if any reusable facts emerged — only if `.claude/memory/` exists (write to the project memory directory)

Keep the summary concise — a future agent should be able to skim it in 30 seconds.
