Every project scaffolded by project-init ships a ``config.yaml`` descriptor

    A descriptor is data the orchestrator only reads, but a ``memory_path`` or

    the project root (``Path('/proj') / '/etc'`` is ``/etc``). Reject any value

    values keep their plain (unresolved) join so callers compare cleanly.

    A path that cannot be resolved at all cannot be shown to be contained, so it
    is rejected too, with its own reason. A symlink loop raises ``RuntimeError``
    on Python 3.11/3.12; a YAML escape that decodes to a NUL raises
    ``ValueError``, and one that decodes to a lone surrogate raises
    ``UnicodeEncodeError``, a ``ValueError``. Raising here would abort discovery
    of the whole fleet over one project's descriptor (PR #262 review).
