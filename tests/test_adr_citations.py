"""Every ADR a file cites must be findable (#189).

Four numbers — ADR-012, ADR-017, ADR-024, ADR-025 — were cited across ``src/``
and ``docs/`` as if they were this repo's decisions, and no file for them exists
in ``.agents/docs/adr/``. They are project-init's ADRs: the descriptor contract,
the tier model and the credential boundary are decided upstream, and this repo
consumes them. A bare ``ADR-025 §4`` read as a local section of a local document
that had no first section, and an audit spent effort looking for it.

So a citation takes one of two forms, and this test enforces it:

- ``ADR-NNN`` — resolves to ``.agents/docs/adr/adr-NNN-*.md`` in this repo;
- ``project-init ADR-NNN`` — resolves to a row of ``.agents/docs/adr/UPSTREAM.md``,
  which names the upstream file. Accepting any qualified number would let a typo
  point at nothing, so the qualifier alone is not enough.

Files project-init renders cite project-init's numbering in project-init's own
words, so that text is fixed upstream, not here. For the scaffold-managed set,
the upgrade base records what project-init rendered. Only lines absent from that
base, the local edits a merge-managed file keeps, are scanned. Both the set and
its base are READ from ``.upgrade-base.json``: a hand-written list of managed
files would be a second copy of a fact the scaffold already records.

The descriptor (``.agents/config.yaml``) has no recorded base and is safe to
hand-edit, so it is scanned too. A comment there whose text matches a comment in
the golden project-init descriptors is project-init's and is blanked; anything
else, a hand-written note or an edited comment, is checked.
