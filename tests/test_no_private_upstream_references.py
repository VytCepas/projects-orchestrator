"""#248: nothing this repo ships or publishes names the private upstream it serves.

This repo is public, and the wheel goes wherever `pip install` takes it. The
`--json` seam and the descriptor's marker rules are consumed by a private
ambient layer, and describing that seam is exactly when its name slips in: the
text reads as ordinary technical prose written by someone with both repos open.
Nothing fails and nothing warns, so the boundary is kept by this test or not at
all. Ported from project-init, which has had the same guard since PI-949.

SCOPE IS DERIVED, NOT LISTED. The shipped set is read out of `pyproject.toml`
at test time — `packages`, `force-include` and the readme — because project-init
enumerated its shipped paths by hand and the list drifted twice: `schemas/` was
force-included into the wheel, picked up a private citation, and would have been
published with that test green (PI-989). A list of shipped paths that disagrees
with the build config is a second copy of a fact.

The scan is deliberately WIDER than the wheel: every file git tracks, because
the repository is public and read by anyone who opens it. The shipped set is
scanned on top of that from the working tree, so a packaged file git does not
track (a generated module, say) is still covered.

Rewording is the remedy, not deletion: the seam is real and its description
must survive. The layer is named by role ("the ambient layer", "the consumer"),
and the marker contract's case ids (H1, M13, M24) are kept, because both sibling
readers assert the same fixtures by those ids.
